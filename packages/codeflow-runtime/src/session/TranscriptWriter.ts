/**
 * TranscriptWriter — append-only event-stream writer for sessions.
 *
 * Implements `crash-recovery.md` decision 4 right-half ("事件流 markdown
 * append-only"): one `<run_id>.md` file per Run, every observed event
 * (8 sdk.* + 4 runtime.* — see `RuntimeEventType` decision M) is
 * append-rendered as one markdown line. Append-only intentionally:
 *
 *   - Atomic-write is unnecessary because partial writes lose only the
 *     in-flight event; the next runtime boot recovers the rest from SDK.
 *   - High frequency (TS-4.3 target = 1000 events/s) makes write-tmp +
 *     rename + fsync per event unaffordable.
 *
 * Design notes (TASK-20260509-013 §主交付 3):
 *
 *   - `attach(runId, handle)` subscribes to the handle's `onEvent` and
 *     returns an `Unsubscribe`. The writer keeps one `WriteStream` per
 *     run open (lazily) and closes it via `close(runId)` or when the
 *     attached handle settles (whichever fires first).
 *   - `append(runId, kind, text)` is the manual ingress used by
 *     `SessionManager.cancelSession` to write the cancel reason without
 *     going through an SDK event.
 *   - `close(runId)` flushes + drains the stream and writes a final
 *     `[ISO] [session_ended]` marker. Idempotent.
 *
 * Performance contract (TS-4.3): `createWriteStream({ flags: "a" })` is
 * used to keep one fd open per run; Node's stream layer handles buffer
 * coalescence so 1000 events/s is comfortable on commodity SSDs without
 * losing data on graceful shutdown. We intentionally do NOT call `fsync`
 * per event — append-only data is allowed to lose the trailing window
 * on `kill -9`, by design (decision 4).
