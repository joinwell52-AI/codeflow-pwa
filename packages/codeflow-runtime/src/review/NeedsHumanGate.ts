/**
 * NeedsHumanGate — the v0.1 fallback when a `decision === "needs_human"`
 * verdict needs to leave the runtime and go to a human.
 *
 * Scope (TASK-20260509-022 §主交付 2):
 *
 * - v0.1 sink = `"cli"` only. The gate prints a single structured line
 *   to the configured `logger.info` so any tail-following operator (or
 *   the `codeflow-shell` daemon's stderr → log file) sees it.
 * - v0.2 will replace the sink with a `MobilePushAdapter` (out of scope
 *   here per TASK-022 §不做 line 238 + design doc §0.9.3 第 4 屏 +
 *   §0.9.4). The constructor signature already accepts `sink: "mobile"`
 *   to lock in the surface — but v0.1 throws if asked to push to mobile
 *   so a regression PR can't accidentally ship a half-implemented push.
 * - The returned `HumanApproval` is a STUB: only `pushed_to + pushed_at +
 *   trigger_reason` are populated (the `additionalProperties: false` schema
 *   for `human_approval` accepts these three plus `approved_by` /
 *   `approved_at`, which v0.1 leaves as `null` until a real human ack
 *   lands via Mobile in v0.2+).
 *
 * Why a stub at all (instead of "wait for ack"):
 *
 * - v0.1's `ReviewEngine` settles synchronously at session_ended time —
 *   blocking on a real human is what v0.2 Mobile push is for. The stub
 *   gives the audit trail a complete `human_approval` block that says
 *   "we pushed; nobody approved yet", which is the truth at v0.1 stage.
 * - The schema's `additionalProperties: false` on `human_approval` means
 *   we MUST NOT invent extra fields here.
 *
 * Reference:
 *   - design doc §0.9.4 high-risk red lines
 *   - design doc §0.9.3 (Mobile Audit screen — v0.2)
 *   - review.schema.json#properties.human_approval
