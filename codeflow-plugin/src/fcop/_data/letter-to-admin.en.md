# A Letter from FCoP to ADMIN — User Manual

Hi ADMIN.

I'm **FCoP** (File-based Coordination Protocol) — a protocol that lets
you and an AI team collaborate through **files**. Your one job:
**tell me how many people this project has and how they split the work.**

| Who | What | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Human** | You | Role code is always `ADMIN`, exactly one instance |
| **AI team** | N agents | N "job positions" named by you (`PM` / `MANAGER` / `ME` …) |

- `ADMIN` **is NOT written into `fcop.json.roles`** — it's FCoP's
  reserved role.
- Your instructions go to the **leader** only; the leader decides what
  to dispatch to other AI roles (Rule 4).
- Even in Solo mode, the single AI role is not you — it's your AI
  assistant.

---

## Three ways to start (ordered by frequency)

### A. Just you (Solo, most common)

Say this to your Agent:

> **"Initialize the project in Solo mode, role code `ME`."**

Tool call:

```
init_solo(role_code="ME", role_label="Me", lang="en")
```

Solo = one agent wearing many hats. You (`ADMIN`) talk to the AI (`ME`)
directly — no multi-level dispatch. But **Rule 0.b still applies**: the
agent first writes a proposal file → does the work → re-reads its own
proposal as a reviewer, using files to split "proposer" from "reviewer".

### B. Use a preset 4-role team

> **"Initialize the project with the `dev-team` preset."**

| Template | For | AI roles | leader |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev-team` | Software dev | `PM` · `DEV` · `QA` · `OPS` | `PM` |
| `media-team` | Content | `PUBLISHER` · `COLLECTOR` · `WRITER` · `EDITOR` | `PUBLISHER` |
| `mvp-team` | Startup MVP | `MARKETER` · `RESEARCHER` · `DESIGNER` · `BUILDER` | `MARKETER` |
| `qa-team` | QA testing | `LEAD-QA` · `TESTER` · `AUTO-TESTER` · `PERF-TESTER` | `LEAD-QA` |

Tool call: `init_project(team="dev-team", lang="en")`

**Presets come with a three-layer doc set** (new in 0.5.4): every
preset ships a full template — `TEAM-README.md` (team positioning) +
`TEAM-ROLES.md` (role boundaries) + `TEAM-OPERATING-RULES.md`
(operating rules) + `roles/{ROLE}.md` (single-role depth), bilingual.
`init_project` drops everything under `docs/agents/shared/` so an
agent just assigned a role reads its own `roles/{ROLE}.md` for
responsibilities and the two top-level files for shared rules — no
need for you to spell anything out. The three-layer structure is a
protocol rule (`fcop-rules.mdc` Rule 4.5), not a soft recommendation.

### C. Build your own team

**Canonical phrasing:**

> **"Build an AI team with 4 roles: `MANAGER` as leader, plus `CODER`,
> `TESTER`, `ARTIST`. Team name 'My Design Studio', English UI."**

Tool call:

```
create_custom_team(
  team_name="My Design Studio",
  roles="MANAGER,CODER,TESTER,ARTIST",
  leader="MANAGER",
  lang="en"
)
```

**Custom teams don't ship role docs — but samples are one click away**:
after creating a custom team, FCoP tells your agent
*"See `fcop://teams/<team>` for reference samples"* (dev-team /
media-team / mvp-team / qa-team each bundles the full **three-layer
template**: `TEAM-README` / `TEAM-ROLES` / `TEAM-OPERATING-RULES` /
`roles/{ROLE}`, bilingual). The agent naturally studies those before
drafting your own team's three-layer set. You can seed it with one
sentence: **"Mirror media-team's chain of command."**

---

## Roles ≠ Agent windows: how many Cursor tabs do you actually open?

**This is the #1 ADMIN pitfall**: `dev-team` lists 4 roles
(`PM / DEV / QA / OPS`), so ADMIN opens 4 Cursor windows up-front.

You don't have to.

| Concept | Lives in | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | `fcop.json` / task filenames | The protocol-level identity — who dispatches to whom, who reports back |
| **Agent (window)** | Each Cursor chat session you open | One window = one role, assigned the moment you type `You are {ROLE} on {team}` |

**FCoP does not require #roles = #windows**. It is a *file* protocol —
if you only open a `PM` window, the `TASK-*-to-DEV.md` files PM writes
will **sit silently in `tasks/`** until you open another window and
assign it `DEV`. That's not a bug; that's the design.

### The easiest way to start

| Open | Assignment | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Current session = PM | Default starter. PM accepts your orders, writes dispatch files, and the queue waits. Open the 2nd window only when PM actually dispatches to DEV |
| **2** | PM + DEV | Pure coding, no test/deploy yet |
| **3** | PM + DEV + QA | When you want self-testing before ship |
| **4** | PM + DEV + QA + OPS | Only when you actually plan to deploy |

**Most people are fine with just one PM window**. Don't pre-open 4 —
idle windows just burn tokens.

### ⚠️ "1 PM window" ≠ Solo mode

Two different things — do not mix them up:

| | `mode: "solo"` | `mode: "team"` + 1 PM window |
|---|---|---|
| Role count | 1 (`ME`) | 4 (`PM/DEV/QA/OPS`) |
| Can dispatch? | No — no subordinate exists | Yes — PM writes `TASK-...-to-DEV.md`, queue waits |
| Switching to team later | Re-run `init_project()` | Just open a new window and type the assignment line |

In plain English: **Solo = "I'll do it all myself"; team-mode with 1 PM
window = "I've hired the crew; I'll call them in as needed"**.

### Standard opening lines

Current window:

> **"You are PM on dev-team"**

Tomorrow you need DEV. Open a new Cursor window, say:

> **"You are DEV on dev-team"** (optionally with `, thread feature_login`)

The two windows **do not chat with each other** — they coordinate
through files under `docs/agents/tasks/`.

---

## Hard rules for custom roles

Role codes go straight into filenames
(`TASK-20260417-001-MANAGER-to-CODER.md`), so the rules come from the
filename grammar:

| Item | Rule | OK ✅ | Not OK ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role code | Starts with uppercase letter; `A-Z` `0-9` `_` `-`; `-` not at start / end / consecutive | `MANAGER` `QA1` `CODER_A` `LEAD-QA` `AUTO-TESTER` | `程序员` `-QA` `PM--QA` `QA.1` `my boss` |
| Role count | ≥ 2 (single role ⇒ use Solo instead) | `MANAGER,CODER` | Only `MANAGER` |
| Leader | Must be in the role list | leader=`MANAGER` | leader=`CEO` (not in list) |
| Reserved | `ADMIN` and `SYSTEM` cannot be used as role codes | `MANAGER` | `ADMIN` `SYSTEM` |
| Team name | Anything; only used for display | "My Design Studio" | — |
| Language | `zh` or `en` | `en` | `English` |

**Naming hints** (to avoid semantic conflicts):

- ✅ Use **job-function words**: `MANAGER` / `CODER` / `WRITER` /
  `EDITOR` / `PM` / `DEV` / `QA`
- ✅ Use **uppercase Pinyin** if a Chinese word fits best:
  `JINGLI` / `CHENGXU` / `CESHI`
- ❌ Avoid **authority words**: `BOSS` / `CHIEF` / `MASTER` / `OWNER` /
  `CEO` / `KING` — the real "boss" is you (`ADMIN`); an AI role
  shouldn't wear that hat.
- ❌ **No non-ASCII**: the filename grammar is strictly ASCII.

## Proactive validation: you talk casually, FCoP stops the bad ones

**You don't need to memorize the rules above.** Every case below is
**stopped before anything hits disk**, with a bilingual concrete
explanation — not "success/failure", but **which field, which character,
and how to fix it**.

| You casually say | Agent tries | FCoP blocks, reason |
|---|---|---|
| "4-role team: `BOSS` `程序员` `测试` `设计师`" | `create_custom_team(roles="BOSS,程序员,...")` | ❌ Role code `'程序员'` illegal: non-ASCII not allowed |
| "Call them `DEV-TEAM` and `QA-1`" | `create_custom_team(roles="DEV-TEAM,QA-1,...")` | ❌ Role code `'DEV-TEAM'` illegal: `-` not allowed (collides with filename separators) |
| "Call it `my boss`" | `create_custom_team(roles="my boss,...")` | ❌ Role code `'my boss'` illegal: no spaces, must start uppercase |
| "Call it `QA.1`" | `create_custom_team(roles="QA.1,...")` | ❌ Role code `'QA.1'` illegal: `.` not allowed |
| "Add `ADMIN` to the team" | `create_custom_team(roles="ADMIN,CODER,...")` | ❌ `'ADMIN'` is FCoP-reserved (the human's identity); cannot be given to an AI |
| "Single role: `MANAGER`" | `create_custom_team(roles="MANAGER", ...)` | ❌ At least 2 roles required; for a single-role setup use `init_solo(...)` |
| "Leader is `CEO`, roles are `MANAGER, CODER`" | `create_custom_team(roles="MANAGER,CODER", leader="CEO")` | ❌ `leader 'CEO'` must be one of the declared roles (current: `MANAGER, CODER`) |
| "`CODER`, `CODER`, `QA`" | `create_custom_team(roles="CODER,CODER,QA", ...)` | ❌ Role code `'CODER'` duplicated |

> **Since 0.4.6, errors walk you through the fix**: say `DEV-TEAM` and
> FCoP replies `Suggested fix: DEV_TEAM (casing / separators
> auto-repaired)`. Say `my boss` → `Suggested fix: MY_BOSS`. Typo the
> leader's casing → `Did you mean 'MANAGER'?` (did-you-mean).
> Suggestions are **hints only** — you always pick the final name.

**9 validation checks total**, all baked into `create_custom_team` /
`init_solo` — you don't call them, they just run:

1. Role code non-empty
2. Must match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$` (uppercase start, only `A-Z` / `0-9` / `_`)
3. No non-ASCII, `-`, `.`, or spaces
4. Cannot be `ADMIN` (reserved for the human)
5. Cannot be `SYSTEM` (reserved for FCoP internals)
6. Non-solo teams: at least 2 roles (single-role → use `init_solo`)
7. No duplicates in the roles list
8. `leader` must be in the roles list
9. Every failure returns a **human-readable bilingual error**, not a boolean

**Want a dry-run before committing?** Have the agent call:

```
validate_team_config(roles="MANAGER,CODER,TESTER,ARTIST", leader="MANAGER")
```

Writes nothing; returns `OK` if valid, otherwise tells you exactly
what's wrong. Useful when you dictate a pile of role names and aren't
sure whether any of them contain illegal characters.

**Bottom line: you don't memorize rules.** Just tell the agent in plain
language what team you want. `create_custom_team` runs these 9 checks
automatically; if it fails, the agent will come back to you with the
concrete reason.

### Three-layer team docs (since 0.5.4)

Team docs under `shared/` **must** split into three layers — this is
a protocol rule (`fcop-rules.mdc` Rule 4.5):

| Layer | File | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Layer 0 · entry | `TEAM-README.md` | What is this team? How does ADMIN engage? What's the typical flow? |
| Layer 1 · role boundaries | `TEAM-ROLES.md` | Who owns what? Who reports to whom? Which lines are off-limits? |
| Layer 2 · operating rules | `TEAM-OPERATING-RULES.md` | How are tasks dispatched, replied to, escalated, retrospected? |
| Layer 3 · single-role depth | `roles/{ROLE}.md` | One role's responsibilities, deliverables, acceptance criteria, interfaces |

`ADMIN` (you) is human — does **not** go under `roles/`, and is **not**
written into `fcop.json.roles`. Your duties live in the "ADMIN
Responsibilities" section of `TEAM-README.md`, not a separate file.

Want to upgrade an old project to the three-layer set, or switch team
templates? Have the agent call
`deploy_role_templates(team="dev-team")` — it auto-archives any
existing files to `.fcop/migrations/<timestamp>/` before dropping the
new templates. Diff-able and recoverable; hand-edits aren't silently
lost.

Every message you send from now on becomes a file:

```
TASK-20260417-001-ADMIN-to-MANAGER.md    ← your instruction
TASK-20260417-001-MANAGER-to-ADMIN.md    ← MANAGER's report
```

**That's the whole of FCoP.**

---

## Where artifacts go: the `workspace/<slug>/` convention

This is the question nobody sees coming on day one and everybody
regrets on day two:

**You ask the agent to build a CSDN search tool; it dumps `app.py`,
`pyproject.toml`, and `*.bat` straight into the project root. Day two
you ask for a small game, `pyproject.toml` collides, `app.py` gets
overwritten, and the `*.bat` files are mixed together with no way to
tell which is which.**

FCoP 0.4.7 bakes the answer into init: **the project root only holds
coordination metadata; actual work products go under
`workspace/<slug>/`. One slug per "thing you're doing", fully
isolated.**

```
codeflow-3/
├── .cursor/ docs/ fcop.json LETTER-TO-ADMIN.md   ← coordination skeleton, never mixed
└── workspace/
    ├── csdn-search/         ← today: CSDN article search
    │   ├── app.py
    │   ├── templates/
    │   ├── *.bat
    │   └── pyproject.toml
    └── mini-game/           ← tomorrow: small game (own cage, fully isolated)
        ├── game.py
        └── assets/
```

### How to open a new cage

Both are fine:

1. **Ask the agent to call** (recommended):

    ```
    new_workspace(slug="csdn-search", title="CSDN Article Search Tool")
    ```

    FCoP creates the directory, writes a minimal README, and drops a
    `.workspace.json` metadata file.

2. **Just `mkdir` it yourself**: make a folder under `workspace/`
    by hand. The agent still recognizes it, and `list_workspaces()`
    still lists it.

### Slug naming rules (FCoP validates automatically)

| ✅ Legal | ❌ Illegal | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `csdn-search` | `CSDN-Search` | lowercase required |
| `mini-game` | `mini_game` | only `-` as separator (inverse of role codes) |
| `weekly-report-2026w17` | `周报` | no non-ASCII |
| `api-v2` | `my game` | no spaces |
| `search` | `tmp` / `shared` / `archive` | reserved |

Same as role codes: mistypes get a friendly "Suggested fix: `xxx`"
reply. Max 40 characters.

### One-shot overview

To see how many cages the project has and what they're for, have the
agent call:

```
list_workspaces()
```

Output shows each slug's title and creation time.
`get_team_status()` also includes the workspace count.

### Hard rules

- ❌ The agent **must not write business code into the project root**
  (`app.py` / `pyproject.toml` etc.)
- ❌ Files are not shared across slugs
- ✅ If you need something shared across cages, open
  `workspace/shared/` — FCoP reserves that slug for exactly this

---

## How you actually use FCoP: just talk

**First, the important part**: FCoP ships 22 tools — **all of them are
for the agent, not for you**. You talk in plain language from start to
finish; the agent translates your intent into the right tool call.

```
You (ADMIN)         Agent (AI)            FCoP toolbox
  speak     ────→   understand   ────→    call the tool
                                              ↓
                                       write files / make dirs / check state
```

You do not have to memorize any tool names. The table below is a
"**when you say X, the agent does Y**" reference — so that *if* the
agent forgets what to do, you can spot it and nudge it back.

### Project kickoff

| You say | Agent calls | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| (first sentence of a new session) | `unbound_report()` | Agent reports project state; tells you if it's uninitialized or unassigned |
| "initialize a Solo project" / "I'll do it myself" | `init_solo(role_code="ME")` | Writes `fcop.json`, creates directories, deploys rules + letter, creates `workspace/` |
| "initialize a dev team" / "I want a 4-role team" | `init_project("dev-team")` or `create_custom_team(...)` | Same as above, multi-role |
| "MCP is bound to the wrong dir" / `unbound_report` shows `C:\Users\xxx` | `set_project_dir("E:\\your-project")` | Rebinds at runtime; no config edits, no restart |
| "you are PM" / "you are ME" | (no tool call; the agent just remembers its role) | Enters Phase 3 and starts working |

### Day-to-day work

| You say | Agent calls | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| "build a CSDN search tool" / "start a new thing for X" | `new_workspace(slug="csdn-search", title="...")` | Creates `workspace/csdn-search/` cage; all artifacts land inside |
| "assign a task to CODER" / "ask X to do Y" | `write_task(recipient="CODER", body="...")` | Drops a `TASK-*-to-CODER.md` |
| "what's the state of the project" | `get_team_status()` | Task / report / issue / workspace counts + recent activity |
| "how many workspaces do we have?" | `list_workspaces()` | Lists every `workspace/<slug>/` with create time |
| "what tasks are still pending?" | `list_tasks()` | Lists unarchived `tasks/` |
| "what does task X say?" | `read_task("TASK-...")` | Reads body |
| "any open issues?" | `list_issues()` | Lists `issues/` |
| "archive X, it's done" | `archive_task("TASK-...")` | Moves to `log/` |
| "show me the completion reports" | `list_reports()` / `read_report(...)` | Reads `reports/` |

### Rescue / edge cases

| You say | Agent calls | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| "I don't like this FCoP rule" | `drop_suggestion("...", "...")` | Feedback lands under `.fcop/proposals/` (you can't edit the rules files yourself) |
| "validate this team config before creating it" | `validate_team_config("MANAGER,CODER", "MANAGER")` | Dry-run check, returns suggestions on error |
| "what team presets exist?" | `get_available_teams()` | Lists Solo / dev-team / media-team / mvp-team / qa-team |
| "upgrade the team docs to the three-layer set" / "switch to qa-team templates" | `deploy_role_templates(team="qa-team")` | Legacy files archived to `.fcop/migrations/<timestamp>/`; fresh three-layer set lands under `shared/` |
| "let me re-read the manual" | Reads `fcop://letter/en` or opens `docs/agents/LETTER-TO-ADMIN.md` | Re-renders this letter |

### The only 2 tool names you might actually type

- **`unbound_report`** — if a new session's agent doesn't auto-report,
  just say "report first" or literally "call `unbound_report`".
- **`set_project_dir`** — when you see the MCP bound to the wrong
  directory (e.g. `unbound_report` shows a `C:\Users\xxx` path), say
  "bind to `E:\your-project`" or literally "call `set_project_dir("...")`".

**The other 20 are never yours to memorize**. The agent picks.

### Why the agent knows what to call

Because FCoP tells it in three places **at once**:

1. **MCP instructions** (always read on agent startup) — includes the
   "when ADMIN says X, call Y" map baked in.
2. **Each tool's docstring** (visible to the agent) — describes exactly
   when to invoke it.
3. **`fcop-rules.mdc`** (`alwaysApply: true`) — enforces hard rules
   like Rule 0.

So your job is just plain language. If the agent misses something
obvious (e.g. doesn't open a workspace when it should, or skips
`unbound_report`), point it at the relevant row of this letter — the
correction takes one line.

### 14 resources (agent-only; you never touch these)

**Core resources** (readable any time):

| URI | Who reads it | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `fcop://rules` | Agent | `fcop-rules.mdc` raw |
| `fcop://protocol` | Agent | `fcop-protocol.mdc` raw |
| `fcop://letter/zh` or `/en` | Agent when it wants to re-read | This letter |
| `fcop://status` | Agent | Same as `get_team_status` |
| `fcop://config` | Agent | `fcop.json` raw |

**Sample library** (0.5.4+, three-layer team templates — browse without initializing):

| URI | What it is |
|---|---|
| `fcop://teams` | Index of all 4 preset teams (dev / media / mvp / qa) |
| `fcop://teams/{team}` | Team's `TEAM-README.md` (positioning + ADMIN duties + flow) |
| `fcop://teams/{team}/TEAM-ROLES` | Layer 1 · role boundaries (Chinese) |
| `fcop://teams/{team}/TEAM-OPERATING-RULES` | Layer 2 · operating rules (Chinese) |
| `fcop://teams/{team}/{role}` | Layer 3 · single-role depth (Chinese; e.g. `.../dev-team/PM`) |
| `fcop://teams/{team}/{role}/en` | Layer 3 · single-role depth (English) |

> Append `/en` to any `.../{role}` or `.../TEAM-*` URI for the English
> version. The pre-0.5.4 `fcop://teams/{team}/PM-01` style still
> resolves (fallback to `roles/PM.md`), but new projects should use
> the clean form without the `-01` suffix.

**You use these samples by just asking — no need to memorize URIs**:

- "Show me dev-team's PM role template" → Agent reads `fcop://teams/dev-team/PM`
- "What are dev-team's role boundaries?" → Agent reads `fcop://teams/dev-team/TEAM-ROLES`
- "How does media-team dispatch tasks?" → Agent reads `fcop://teams/media-team/TEAM-OPERATING-RULES`
- "I want to create LEAD-DEV — which sample is closest?" → Agent picks one for you
- "What presets are available?" → Agent reads `fcop://teams` or calls `get_available_teams()`

### ⚠️ Cursor's "click-to-grey-out" switches: 2 you must never grey

Cursor's MCP panel shows these 22 tools as buttons. Click → greyed =
disabled. **Greying these two will hurt you**:

- `unbound_report` — greyed out, Rule 0 breaks; agents can't take
  their mandatory first step
- `set_project_dir` — greyed out, your only rescue for a
  wrong-directory binding is editing `mcp.json` + restarting Cursor

The other 20 can technically be greyed out, but the agent just gets
confused when a tool suddenly disappears — **keep them all enabled**.

## Four must-read rules (cheat sheet)

| # | Rule | One line |
|---|---|---|
| 0.a | Land it as a file | Unfiled chat = never happened |
| 0.b | Multi-role checks | No single AI does decision-to-execution alone |
| **0.c** | **Only land true things** | **No fabrication; every reference cited** |
| 1 | UNBOUND | New sessions call `unbound_report()` first and wait for you |

Full 9-rule set: `.cursor/rules/fcop-rules.mdc` (agents read it
automatically). Commentary (naming, YAML, layout, patrol, citation
formats for 0.c, …): `.cursor/rules/fcop-protocol.mdc`.

---

## Upgrading fcop (automated from 0.5.3 onward)

The FCoP toolbox (the `fcop` Python package) gets updates. From 0.5.3 on,
you don't have to remember anything:

**Every new session's `unbound_report()` automatically tells you at the
tail whether a new version is available.**

It looks like this:

```
📦 fcop update available: 0.5.4 → 0.5.5

- Agent: call upgrade_fcop() — one-line upgrade + restart reminder
- Shell: pip install --upgrade fcop (then fully close & reopen Cursor)

When you see the banner, two upgrade paths:

### Path 1: let the agent upgrade (easiest)

One line:

> upgrade fcop

The agent calls `upgrade_fcop()`, uses its own Python to run
`pip install --upgrade fcop`, reports the version delta, and reminds
you to restart Cursor.

### Path 2: run it yourself (also fine)

```powershell
pip install --upgrade fcop
```

Then fully close Cursor and reopen it. On Windows: **use Task Manager
to kill every `Cursor.exe` process** — closing windows alone leaves
background processes that keep the old MCP alive.

### To check "is there a new version right now"

One line:

> is there a new fcop version?

The agent calls `check_update()` — skips the 24h cache, asks PyPI
directly.

### ⚠️ Important reminders

- After upgrade you **must restart Cursor** — without restart, the
  running MCP is still on the old version
- Do NOT let the agent hand-edit `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or the version
  fields in `fcop.json` — that's not upgrading, it's corrupting the
  protocol
- The banner refreshes every 24h (so PyPI isn't queried on every
  session); silently skipped when offline

---

## When you disagree

- Want the full rules → have the agent read `fcop://rules` or
  `fcop://protocol`
- Disagree with the protocol itself → have the agent call
  `drop_suggestion("...", "...")`; feedback lands under
  `.fcop/proposals/` without polluting the collaboration directory
- Want to switch templates → one line: "re-initialize with `{team}`"
- Want to re-read this letter → `fcop://letter/en` or
  `docs/agents/LETTER-TO-ADMIN.md`

Welcome aboard.
